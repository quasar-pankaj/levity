# Levity - A simple fast and lightweight programming language.

Levity is a simple, fast and lightweight programming language that is not really intended for production use. It is more of a learning tool for people who want to know how programming languages work. This language will be based on RPN syntax otherwise known as postfix notation. This language will be written in C++ and will also demonstrate the archetectural design patterns.

Following is the Todo list for the project:-

- Create a basic interpreter
- Create a basic compiler
- Create a basic VM
- Create a basic lexer
- Create a basic parser
- Create a basic debugger
- Take a look at the infix based languages and see if we can implement them in the language
